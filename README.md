in a big javascript project, sometimes you can forget to delete a unused file.

linters and tree-shakers are good at finding unused code in a module, but they can allow you to have a whole unused file somewhere in your project.

This script follows the require graph, and compares it to the `ls` output, to find any files that are potentially not being used.

`npm install -g unrequired`

`unrequired ./path/to/my/index.js`

There are probably some caveats to this, but running it may be helpful in a large javascript project.

It uses (ðŸ’Ÿ) [browserify](http://browserify.org/) and [source-map-explorer](https://github.com/danvk/source-map-explorer).
